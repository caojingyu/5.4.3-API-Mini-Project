# This exercise will require you to pull some data from the Qunadl API. Qaundl is currently the most widely used aggregator of financial market data.

# As a first step, you will need to register a free account on the http://www.quandl.com website.

# After you register, you will be provided with a unique API key, that you should store:

# In[2]:


# Store the API key as a string - according to PEP8, constants are always named in all upper case
API_KEY = 'tTdE-g2xf1bypk8fp6du'


# Qaundl has a large number of data sources, but, unfortunately, most of them require a Premium subscription. Still, there are also a good number of free datasets.

# For this mini project, we will focus on equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE), which is available for free. We'll try and analyze the stock prices of a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, as well as medical lasers for laser eye surgery: https://www.zeiss.com/meditec/int/home.html. The company is listed under the stock ticker AFX_X.

# You can find the detailed Quandl API instructions here: https://docs.quandl.com/docs/time-series

# While there is a dedicated Python package for connecting to the Quandl API, we would prefer that you use the *requests* package, which can be easily downloaded using *pip* or *conda*. You can find the documentation for the package here: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/ 

# Finally, apart from the *requests* package, you are encouraged to not use any third party Python packages, such as *pandas*, and instead focus on what's available in the Python Standard Library (the *collections* module might come in handy: https://pymotw.com/3/collections/ ).
# Also, since you won't have access to DataFrames, you are encouraged to us Python's native data structures - preferably dictionaries, though some questions can also be answered using lists.
# You can read more on these data structures here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html

# Keep in mind that the JSON responses you will be getting from the API map almost one-to-one to Python's dictionaries. Unfortunately, they can be very nested, so make sure you read up on indexing dictionaries in the documentation provided above.

# Inspect the JSON structure of the object you created, and take note of how nested it is,
# as well as the overall structure


# These are your tasks for this mini project:
# 
# 1. Collect data from the Franfurt Stock Exchange, for the ticker AFX_X, for the whole year 2017 (keep in mind that the date format is YYYY-MM-DD).
# 2. Convert the returned JSON object into a Python dictionary.
# 3. Calculate what the highest and lowest opening prices were for the stock in this period.
# 4. What was the largest change in any one day (based on High and Low price)?
# 5. What was the largest change between any two days (based on Closing Price)?
# 6. What was the average daily trading volume during this year?
# 7. (Optional) What was the median trading volume during this year. (Note: you may need to implement your own function for calculating the median.)
